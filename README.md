# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets to understand public opinion and emotional responses related to specific entities, brands, or topics. The goal is to extract insights regarding the sentiment distribution (positive, negative, neutral) across various entities, using text data from social media.

The project includes key tasks such as data cleaning, preprocessing, sentiment classification using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), and visualizing sentiment trends. The overall goal is to provide actionable insights on how different entities or brands are perceived based on social media discourse.

## Notebook Highlights
The Jupyter notebook includes:
- **Dataset Overview**: A comprehensive description of the dataset, including its source and key variables. It covers the structure of the dataset, such as tweet text, sentiment labels, and additional entity-related columns.
  
- **Data Cleaning Process**: The methodology applied for cleaning the data. This includes removing duplicates, handling missing values, and text preprocessing steps (such as lowercasing, tokenization, and removing special characters).

- **Sentiment Classification**: Sentiment analysis is performed using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to classify each tweet as **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative** based on the content of the tweet.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations that showcase sentiment distribution, word clouds, and sentiment trends across various entities or brands. This section reveals patterns and relationships in the dataset.
  
- **Entity-Level Sentiment Analysis**: A detailed analysis of sentiment breakdown for specific entities or brands. Insights include sentiment classification for each entity and a recommendation on how to improve public perception based on sentiment trends.

- **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions derived from the sentiment analysis results. These recommendations are aimed at improving brand reputation, addressing negative sentiment, and enhancing customer engagement.

## Libraries Used
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting graphs.
- **seaborn**: For advanced visualization techniques.
- **vaderSentiment**: For performing sentiment analysis using the VADER sentiment analysis tool.
